# ROVR Social VR Platform

## Overview
![Socal VR Platform](ROVR_IMAGE.png)

The social VR platform allows geographically distanced groups to meet in VR. The system is developed in Unreal Engine using the OnlineSubSystem peer to peer network functionality, which requires a known IP address for the host and related network settings (usually port forwarding and remove of firewall). Users are able to interate verbally through Vivox voice services - both direction audio and posional audio and enabled within this platform.

The Social Platform functions on both PC & Android (Pico Neo 2).
